# Lyrica Rating System

I was still in high school when I made this project for fun, and that was back in 2008...but hey, the mechanisms it uses are fairly general and they could be used for some other project.

The main idea was, on the internet there are Japan Saimoe, Korea Saimoe, International Saimoe, in short there are tons of websites who host popularity contests for Japanese animation characters. And then I thought, this all great but what about video game characters? At that time I was a huge Touhou fan (I might still be, who knows?) and I wanted to do all the characters in Touhou some justice. If those games have such a wide fandom community, why wouldn't we try to assess each character's popularity ?

And thus Lyrica (named after one of the characters, Lyrica Prismriver) was born. Of course, most Saimoe-type contests had precise events on a calendar and tournament formats but wouldn't it be more simple for starters to just let people vote whenever they want? A ranking would then gradually emerge from the continuous voting. This is the reasoning that made Lyrica, basically, an implementation of Facemash. Of course there are a few options such as authentification and the ability to choose the games from which you want the characters, so you don't have to vote between characters you've never heard of. But there it is.

Of course, as such Lyrica relies heavily on random generation of pairs (or so-to-speak matches), and the Elo rating system (the same they use for chess, Go, or even League of Legends at some point) to assess each character's popularity. And now I guess you can use it and do whatever you want with it. Just tell me if you do and show me what you've done with it; I'd appreciate :)

Oh and in case you wondered...no, rather: have you ever wondered why my ID was LrsNate? Well there you go :)
